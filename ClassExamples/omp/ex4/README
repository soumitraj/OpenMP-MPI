This example shows how to schedule a for loop statically across a team of
OpenMP threads.
Compile using: mpicc test.c -openmp

Set environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, which represents the number
of threads the program will use when it runs.
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<numThreads>
e.g.
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2

Run using:     ./a.out

This example shows how a for loop is statically scheduled across a 
group of OpenMP threads.
Compile using: mpicc test.c -openmp

Set environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS, which represents the number 
of threads the program will use when it runs.
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<numThreads>
e.g.
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=5

Run using:     ./a.out
